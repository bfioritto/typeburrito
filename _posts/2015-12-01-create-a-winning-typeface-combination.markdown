We’ve all been there: you’ve got a design direction and you’re ready to go, only to be sucked into hours of fruitless tinkering with different header/body typeface combos, and then hating all the results!

You know you need to pick typefaces that will work well together, but it seems like there’s a lot more to it than meets the eye, and you don’t have a year to get up to speed on the ins and outs of typography.

Don’t worry: you don’t need to know all the rules. A few simple guidelines will give you a framework for making great type choices every time. Just remember three things: Quality, Goldilocks, and Harmonious Contrast. 

Quality

If you remember nothing else, remember the golden rule: always use high-quality fonts.

Bad fonts can mean poor spacing and kerning, missing glyphs, and more, so save yourself the trouble! If your client has room in their budget, I recommend purchasing fonts that are well-suited to your project, but if that’s not in the cards, there are plenty of excellent free fonts out there. Admittedly, finding a high-quality typeface can be time-consuming and daunting: not sure how to spot a winner? Here are a bunch of great suggestions. 

Goldilocks (Pick type for your body text)

Start by picking a great typeface for your body copy—this is the typeface where users will spend most of their time reading, so it’s important that it’s well-suited to that purpose. So when you’re designing typography, think reader, not user. What do readers need? Well, readers are like goldilocks: they need type that is just right. Not too wide or narrow, not too heavy or light—clear, legible typefaces with letterforms that are fairly standard and not too unusual or surprising. This isn’t the place to get fancy: letters with too much character will distract from reading. 

Another reason to start with with the typeface for your body copy? Your website is likely going to have a lot of text, so it’s going to take up most of the space. It’s important for your overall design to pick something with a feel that supports what you are trying to achieve. Want a clean, modern look? Make sure the typeface for your body text fits the bill.

Harmonious Contrast

Now that you’ve selected a high-quality typeface for your body text, it’s time to pick a typeface that you can use for headers or other larger pieces of text (sometimes referred to as a display face). It’s okay to go for something that’s a little more expressive here, or keep it simple too! Just remember to keep your reader in mind and don’t pick something that will be too distracting.

When you are combining two typefaces, the key thing to remember is contrast. If the typefaces are too similar, they will clash. To the untrained eye (like your reader,) it’s going to feel like something is “off.” But if your typefaces are too wildly different the effect can be jarring: they need to feel related somehow; harmonious. Depending on the needs of your design, you might need more of one than the other. You might be familiar with the idea of unity and variety in art or design—the idea that compositions need to be cohesive yet also have some visual interest—that’s what you are trying to achieve with your combination. Your typefaces need to contrast, but they must also be harmonious. Here are a few different approaches you can take:

—Font Family. This is a safe approach that works because the type is designed to work together. The downside is it can look a bit conservative because the typefaces are so uniform: there’s not a lot of contrast. One solution to add interest is to pick a family that has both serif and sans serif faces such as Scala, and use one classification for headers, one for body copy.

—Serif with Sans-serif. This is a pretty sure-fire way to pick a good font combination. Pick one as a display face, the other as the body. This approach has a lot of contrast by nature, so look for ways to unify the two faces. Study the forms of the typefaces side by side: do they have a similar character width? A similar x-height? Are the round letters more geometric (perfectly round) or not? If the two faces don’t have some kind of structural commonality, they probably won’t work great together. Keep in mind harmony and contrast: the greater the contrast of forms, the more attention your type will draw.

—Like with Like. It can be tricky to pair faces that share a classification (ie serif with serif): if the faces are too similar, they’ll clash. But thinking in terms of harmony and contrast, you can still make great pairings. Your body text will likely be less quirky since you picked a “Goldilocks” typeface, so a display face with more character is a good way to introduce some variety and avoid clashing. Other ways to create contrast are through weight, width, and style: again, you can assess those kinds of structural similarities and differences by looking at the type closely side by side. 

2 examples

—Script and Handwriting Fonts. I don’t advise using a script or handwriting font for body text, but when used with care, these can work as a display face with either a serif or sans-serif body text. You will be starting with a lot of contrast between the two typefaces, so examine the structures of the letters to find some similarities. The letterforms themselves might not have a lot in common, but look at things like the width, x-height, and style (formal, informal, modern, traditional, etc) to bring a little harmony to the pairing.
