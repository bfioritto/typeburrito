We’ve all been there: you’ve got a design direction and you’re ready to go, only to be sucked into hours of fruitless tinkering with different header/body typeface combos, but the result just ends up looking like a flyer for a missing cat.

You know you need to pick typefaces that will work well together, but it seems like there’s a lot more to it than meets the eye, and you don’t have a year to get up to speed on the ins and outs of typography.

Don’t worry: you don’t need to know all the rules. A few simple guidelines will have you making great type choices in no time.

Pairing type really involves two skills: picking great typefaces, and the actual pairing.

Not sure how to pick a quality typeface? Read part 1 (link) of this series.

<em>Remember: you are the expert on your project’s objectives! The more in tune you are with these, the more decisive you’ll be, and the happier you'll be with the results.</em>
So: you’ve got a design direction, and you know you’re going to need a couple different typefaces to get the job done. Where to start?

<h2>Start with the Text Face</h2>

Why? Because there’s more of it. It will have a bigger visual impact on your design, so make sure it’s spot-on. Just as importantly, the reader will spend much more time reading this typeface, so pick something highly legible that can be read comfortably in long blocks. Choosing type is like picking a voice for your content. Your text face needs to be a newscaster: it’s essential that your type “speak” clearly so it can be understood by everyone.

Your display face can have a bit more character, but don’t go for anything overly difficult to read. The main job of type is to be read.

<h2>Unity and Variety</h2>

There is this concept in art of unity and variety—the idea is that all compositions need both. If a composition is only unified, the viewer may lose interest. If there’s too much variety, there’s nothing holding the composition together: it’s chaos.

This applies to pairing type as well. When you are combining two typefaces, it is essential that there is some contrast between them (variety), as well as some elements in common (unity).

Depending on the needs of your design, there are a few different approaches you can take:

<em>Font Family.</em> This is a safe approach that works because the type is designed to work together. It can look a bit conservative because there's not a lot of contrast, but it's a sure-fire way to make sure your type pairing works.

<em>Serif with Sans-serif.</em> This is great approach because there's already an element of variety (serif vs. sans). Pick one as a display face, the other as the body.
Since you're starting with a lot of contrast, look for ways to unify the two faces. Study the forms of the typefaces side by side: do they have a similar character width? A similar x-height? Are the round letters more geometric (perfectly round) or not? If the two faces don’t have some kind of structural commonality, they probably won’t work great together.

<em>Like with Like.</em> It can be tricky to pair faces that share a classification (e.g. serif with serif). Just like the black shirt you washed one too many times doesn’t quite match your black pants, they’re close, but something is definitely off. But thinking in terms of unity and variety, you can still make great pairings. With this approach you start with a lot of unity, so seek out variety. One way is to find faces that have very different levels of contrast (the difference between thick and thin strokes). Other ways to create variety are through weight, width, and style: examine the type at a large size side by side to see what the letterforms offer for a good mix of unity and variety.

<em>Script and Handwriting Fonts.</em> I don’t advise using a script or handwriting font for body text, but when used thoughtfully, these can work as a display face with either a serif or sans-serif text face. You are starting with a lot of inherent contrast, so examine the structures of the letters to find some similarities. The letterforms themselves might not have a lot in common, but think about what each is communicating through its style (formal/informal, modern, traditional, etc) to bring harmony to the pairing.

If you have two fonts that work together but still seem a little too similar, try changing the size or weight to add some variety.

Need more unity? The easiest place to start is to look at the shapes of the letterforms. Or try something more subtle and sophisticated: unify your typography by finding type designed around the same time, or to find type inspired by the same tool or medium (broad-nib pen, carved in stone, etc—you can usually figure this out with just a bit of googling).

Pairing type doesn’t need to be mysterious or scary! Start with quality typefaces, (link to part 1) think unity and variety, and pair away!

Remember that you are the expert on the most important aspect of choosing and pairing type: the requirements of your project. The more you internalize these objectives, the better your choices will be.
