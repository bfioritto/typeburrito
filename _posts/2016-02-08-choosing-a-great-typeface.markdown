Ugh, picking type! Of course it's important—good typography is the foundation of good web design—but before you know it, you're looking at 20 nearly-identical typefaces, second-guessing yourself, and wondering whether it really matters which one you pick. 

So then you go looking for help—lists of <a href="http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/">"great"</a> fonts, or the "best" of a particular <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/top-10-helvetica-alternatives">kind of font</a>, but you still have no way to pick between them or know what makes them "great" in the first place. So then you think maybe you could play it even safer and just copy what someone else did. But that just leads to more self-doubt.

First of all: you've GOT this! Choosing great type doesn't need to be magical and mysterious. In fact, you're already the expert on the most important part. You just need a straightforward way for evaluating type, and you'll be a type-picking machine in no time!

<h2>Type: The Basics</h2>

The most important question you need to ask is "does this help to accomplish my design objectives?" And, good news, everyone! You're the expert on that. <em>The tighter you have your objectives in focus, the easier it is to make design decisions.</em> So when you're picking type, keep those priorities in mind.

Now for some Type 101! To figure out if a typeface is going to work for your project, you need to know your way around a letterform. 

(illustration 1: illustration with labeled x-height, counters, serifs)

<em>X-height:</em> The height of most lowercase letters (such as the letter x) in the typeface. At small sizes, shorter x-heights are generally harder to read than taller x-heights.

<em>Counters:</em> The enclosed parts of letters like b, d, or p. Just like short x-heights, small counters can make reading hard at small sizes.

<em>Serifs:</em> You know these guys—the little strokes sticking off the ends of letters. Conventional wisdom says that serifs make type easier to read. <a href="http://alexpoole.info/blog/which-are-more-legible-serif-or-sans-serif-typefaces/">However research shows this isn’t really the case.</a> Legibility is affected most by how quickly and easily the reader is able to recognize letter forms. So don’t sweat the serifs one way or the other!

<em>Contrast:</em> The difference between the thickest and thinnest parts of a letter. High-contrast type is harder to read at small sizes. The thin parts seem to disappear, so letters are harder to make out. Even if you can see the fine lines, an effect called dazzling makes small, high-contrast type uncomfortable for reading. Avoid it at small sizes. (illustration 2: illustration of one letter in diff faces, most to least contrast)

<em>Color:</em> When talking about type this actually has nothing to do with actual color, but with how dark or light a block of text looks from afar: if it’s too dark and dense it can be difficult to read. Don’t use bold weights for long blocks of text, and if necessary add more line spacing if your paragraphs look daunting to read. (illustration 3: illustration of same paragraph in two typefaces)

<em>Text Faces vs. Display Faces:</em> Most type is designed with a specific context in mind. Type for small sizes, intended for longer reading, is called a text face and is designed to be legible and comfortable for reading at “text” sizes. 

Display faces are for short text such as titles, signage, or headlines. They are designed to work best at larger sizes, and tend to be more expressive than text faces. 

Often the description of the typeface will tell you what kind of a typeface you’re looking at: heed to those labels. If they aren’t labeled, use the features above to steer you in the right direction.

<h2>Quality Digital Type</h2>

So you found a typeface you really like for your project, but how do you know if it’s “good?” Again, this is largely determined by your needs.

<h3>Weights, Widths, Styles</h3>

For text faces, you want to make sure you have a “complete” typeface. These days that means a regular, italic, bold, and bold italic version. For display faces you may only need one style or weight, but think carefully about all the ways you will use it. Will you need a bold or italic? If so, you need a typeface that has those options. On the other end of the spectrum, many typefaces have so many weights and widths you don’t know what to do with all of them! The truth is you’ll probably never need all of them, though you may decide you prefer a certain weight over another—maybe the light looks better than regular for your body copy. 

You really only need regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic. If a typeface lacks one of those, it’s probably not a practical choice, even if you like the look. 

<h3>The Devilish Details</h3>

Quality typefaces have been designed with care. This is going to shine through in a number of different ways.

<em>Languages:</em> Well-designed typefaces have special characters for most (or all) of the languages that use the latin alphabet. So if your design will live online, it’s a good idea to have these characters. That way, as many users as possible will be seeing the type you’ve so carefully chosen.

<em>Special Characters:</em> You may not need additional characters such as an ampersand, small caps, or old-style numerals. But you might. These kinds of details can add a level of polish to your typography. Less frequently used on the web but still worth considering are ligatures, particularly with more traditional-style serifed typefaces. If this is something you know you’ll want to use (maybe in your display face?), then check that you have those glyphs.

<em>Proper Punctuation:</em> Carefully-designed typefaces have different glyphs for true quotation marks (“curly quotes”) and inch marks. Don’t get stuck with dumb quotes! Not sure if you’re using the right marks? (link) Here’s a good guide.

<em>Kerning and Spacing:</em> Same idea here: a well-designed typeface will be thoughtfully and carefully letter-spaced and kerned. So test out your typeface and make sure it’s up to snuff. 

<em>Quality Letterforms:</em> Admittedly, it can be tricky to explain what makes a letterform poorly-drawn. But trust your gut—you’ve seen a lot of type in your life, not just as a designer, but also as a reader. You have an instinct about letterforms and you should trust it. When you test out the typeface, notice your reaction. Do the letterforms seem awkward-looking? If the answer is yes, particularly with a cheap or free font, steer clear. Quality typefaces tend to have a sense of balance and unity that, even if you don’t know much about type design, you can feel just by looking. Repeated elements (the curve of n, h, m) should look consistent, letters should have a similar amount of contrast and weight of stroke, the tops of B and R shouldn’t feel like they’re about to topple over. If a typeface “feels” wrong to you, it’s probably poorly drawn. Trust your gut and find something better. 

<h3>Free Fonts</h3>

There are a lot of great free fonts out there, but it’s important to know what you’re getting so you can make an informed decision. Free fonts fall into a few categories.

<em>Sample Fonts:</em> Excellent quality fonts in only one or two weights. I love Sanchez Slab and have the full family on my system. It’s a high-quality font and follows all the rules outlined above. But having only one weight on google fonts? Not particularly useful. Always start with your project’s requirements and base your decisions on those.

<em>Open-Source Fonts:</em> I love these! The main drawback with these (true of any free font) is the lack of exclusivity. Anyone can use them, so there’s the potential that they may be over-used. But from a functional perspective, they tend to be well-designed and offer a lot of options for typesetting.

<em>Fan and Novelty Fonts:</em> These are probably the easiest to avoid. They tend to be the most poorly drawn and lack most necessary characters. Fans of TV shows and video games, type hobbyists, and other ameteur type designers create fonts based on logos they love, their handwriting and other “wouldn’t it be cool if…?” inspirations. These are not suitable for most design applications. 

<h2>Research Pays Off</h2>

Even with these guidelines for picking type, the most important thing to keep in mind is the needs of your project. Spending some time up front doing research will help your type design sparkle. Consider what you’re trying to communicate and how your type can help you. Type from a certain time period, designed for a certain industry or medium, or to use in a particular context can go far in subtly highlighting ideas you’re trying to express. (illustration 4: illustration of a short passage set with type that is appropriate to content vs. times new roman)

As an added bonus, research helps you clarify your thinking. When you share your work with your client, you’ll be able to explain specifically why you made the choices you did. <em>They’ll appreciate your work all the more.</em>

<h2>To Summarize...</h2>

How do you choose great type?

It starts with <em>knowing the requirements of your project</em>, and to keep that in focus as you make design decisions. 

Pick the <em>right kind of type for the job.</em> Know the difference between a text face and a display face, and what elements of type will make it good for one or the other.

Make sure the typeface is <em>up to the challenge</em>: check that it has adequate characters for multiple languages and your typesetting needs, including proper punctuation. 

<em>Pick a well-drawn face</em> that doesn’t look awkward: look for good spacing and kerning, no clunky letterforms. 

Don’t be afraid to <em>do some research.</em> A thoughtfully-chosen typeface can take your project to the next level and make you look like a superstar.
