Type Burrito is a project of Beth Fioritto (that's me!)

I am a web design consultant and I'm fascinated with the dual nature of typeâ€”its beauty, its utility. Detail-oriented is my middle name. Want to work with me? Get in touch at beth.lukes@gmail.com.

Designers have both expertise and gaps in their knowledge that differ widely from one designer to the next. We're continually learning new skills and honing our craft. I hope this site will be a resource and a source of inspiration as you deepen your knowledge and practice of typography.

When I'm not scrutinizing serifs, I'm running after my toddler son, "helping" my husband cook dinner, going for walks, singing in a choir, renovating my house, and binge-watching House of Cards.

<h3>Why Type Burrito?</h3>

My goal is that everything you want to know about typography will be here, wrapped up in one delicious package. The original inspiration comes from the fact (often pointed out by clever children or inebriated adults) that <i>burrito</i> sounds a lot like <i>Fioritto,</i> so I figure, why not roll with it?

<h3>The Logo</h3>

The Type Burrito logo is set in <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Ultra">Ultra</a> and the words are filled with an image of metal type in a type-setting tray. The photograph was taken by flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/matt_moonlight/9171680561/in/faves-54686491@N00/">"Matt Moonlight,"</a> some rights reserved.
