<h2>Part 1: Choosing Type</h2>

<h3>The Basics</h3>

<p>Know whether you're looking for a <em>text face</em> (small type for body copy) or a <em>display face</em> (larger type to grab attention).
</p>

<p>Display Face Rules:
There are no rules! (Well, make sure people can read it.)
</p>

Text Face Rules (to make sure it is legible at small sizes):

• x-height is not too short
• counters aren’t too small
• no super high-contrast type 
• nothing too bold or dark. If the text block looks dark:
  • pick something else
  • add space between lines.

What is Quality?
• enough weights and styles for your needs
• enough characters in the font to display other (latin-alphabet) languages
• special characters if you decide you need them, such as:
  • small caps
  • old-style numerals
  • ligatures
• proper punctuation glyphs
• well-kerned and spaced
• well-drawn letter-forms (use your judgement! trust yourself here!)

Be Cautious with Free Fonts:
• sample fonts may not have enough weights and styles
• novelty fonts are probably poorly drawn and kerned with incomplete character sets
• open-source fonts are highly functional but be aware that they may feel played out or over-used.

Do some research! 
It will pay off in the form of thoughtful typography. And you can show your client how amazing and smart you are by sharing your sparkling insights with them! 

Part 2: Pairing Type

Start with the Text Face: 
• most likely, there’s more of it in your design
• falling in love with particular display face can sometimes box you in

Think Unity and Variety when you pair type: not too similar, not too much contrast between the faces. 

Places to find Unity and/or Variety:
• letter shapes (e.g., geometric forms?)
• letter proportions (e.g., x-height to ascenders or descenders)
• level of contrast
• weight, width, or style of letterforms
• time period of design
• tools used to create or inspire the designs (usually easy to discover with a bit of research)
